				Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment
			</h2>
			To reduce the risk of environmental liability, a Phase I ESA is
			frequently conducted prior to real property financial transactions. It
			is very important for the client to understand the experience and
			knowledge of the consultant, as well as what can be expected to be
			found within the context of the proposed scope of work. All CERES Phase
			I ESAs are conducted under the direction of a Registered Environmental
			Assessor (REA) or other appropriate qualification.
			<br />
			<br />
			CERES&apos; Phase I ESAs are designed to follow Standard E1527-00 (or
			E2247-02 if appropriate), set forth by the American Society for Testing
			and Materials (ASTM). CERES can expand the scope of this Standard if
			desired, or comply with specific institutional standards
			<h2 className='text-2xl py-4 font-bold underline'>
				Transaction Screen Assessment
			</h2>
			Often referred to as the “watered-down” Phase I ESA, the TSA is
			designed to satisfy the due diligence requirements set forth in ASTM
			Standard E1528-00.
			<br />
			<br />
			The TSA is appropriate for users who are confident in their knowledge
			of a property’s past use but still need an assessment of current use.
			The report includes a questionnaire that is completed by a
			“knowledgeable person” as well as other, but not all, elements of the
			Phase I ESA.
			<br />
			<br />
			The TSA has been quite well-received by lenders with well-devised
			environmental protocols for portfolio properties and loan renewals. The
			TSA is recommended for residential and other properties that are not
			normally expected to have environmental concerns. Some lenders feel
			that the TSA is an inexpensive method of updating previous Phase I
			ESAs.

				Historical Aerial Photo Archive
			</h2>
			CERES maintains an archive of historical aerial photographs of many
			developed areas of southern California. The bulk of the collection is
			of the Los Angeles Basin from 1928 through 1989. CERES offers
			electronic copies of these images in PDF or JPG formats. After
			consultation with CERES staff regarding the area of interest, images
			are usually sent to your email within 24 to 48 hours. Call CERES for
			the cost of this service at 1-800-258-1490.
