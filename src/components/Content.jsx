					Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment Service
				</h1>
				<p>
					To reduce the risk of environmental liability, a Phase I ESA is
					conducted prior to real property financial transactions. It is
					very important for the client to understand the experience and
					knowledge of the consultant, as well as what can be expected to
					be found within the context of the proposed scope of work. All
					CERES Phase I ESAs are conducted under the direction of a
					Registered Environmental Property Assessor (REPA).
				</p>
				<p>
					CERES&apos; Phase I ESAs are designed to follow Standard
					E1527-21, set forth by the American Society for Testing and
					Materials (ASTM). CERES can expand the scope of this Standard if
					desired, or comply with specific institutional standards
